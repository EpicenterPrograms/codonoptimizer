# Codon optimizer

## Purpose
Generating a DNA sequence optimized for one or more organisms.

## Usage
### "DNA here" box
Paste in the coding sequence you want to be optimized (preferably including the stop codon), and the program will convert it into amino acids and then back into an optimized DNA sequence for you to use.
### "Amino acids here" box
Paste in the 1-letter amino acid sequence of your protein of interest (preferably with a stop codon represented as an asterisk), and the program will generate a DNA sequence optimized for your organism(s) of interest.

## Interpreting the DNA output
The score shows how well the sequence meets your criteria, and the GC content helps you double-check the sequence viability. The nucleotides are color-coded per codon based on the overall rarity of the codon: more green is more common whereas more blue is less common. Occasional blue is expected, but abundant blue may lead to decreased translation efficiency.
